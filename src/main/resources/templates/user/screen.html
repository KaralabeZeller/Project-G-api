    <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></span></h2>
    <p>At the beginning of the game, each player<br />is secretly assigned to one of three roles:<br /><strong>Liberal</strong>, <strong>Fascist</strong>, or <strong>Hitler</strong>. The Liberals have<br />a majority, but they don&rsquo;t know for sure who<br />anyone is; Fascists must resort to secrecy and<br />sabotage to accomplish their goals. Hitler plays<br />for the Fascist team, and the Fascists know<br />Hitler&rsquo;s identity from the outset, but Hitler<br />doesn&rsquo;t know the Fascists and must work to<br />figure them out.</p>
    <p>The Liberals win by enacting five Liberal<br />Policies or killing Hitler. The Fascists win by<br />enacting six Fascist Policies, or if Hitler is<br />elected Chancellor after three Fascist Policies<br />have been enacted.</p>
    <p>Whenever a Fascist Policy is enacted, the<br />government becomes more powerful, and the<br />President is granted a single-use power which<br />must be used before the next round can begin. It<br />doesn&rsquo;t matter what team the President is on; in<br />fact, even Liberal players might be tempted to<br />enact a Fascist Policy to gain new powers.</p>
    <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OBJECT</strong></span></h2>
    <p>Every player has a secret identity as a member<br />of either the Liberal team or the Fascist team.<br />Players on the Liberal team win if either:</p>
    <p>&bull; Five Liberal Policies are enacted.</p>
    <p>OR</p>
    <p>&bull; Hitler is assassinated.</p>
    <p>Players on the Fascist team win if either:</p>
    <p>&bull; Six Fascist Policies are enacted.</p>
    <p>OR</p>
    <p>&bull; Hitler is elected Chancellor any time after<br />the third Fascist Policy has been enacted.</p>
    <h3><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></span></h3>
    <p><br />Secret Hitler is played in rounds. Each round<br />has an Election to form a government, a<br />Legislative Session to enact a new Policy, and an<br />Executive Action to exercise governmental power.</p>
    <h4><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>ELECTION</em></span></strong></h4>
    <p><br />1. <strong>Pass the Presidential Candidacy</strong><br />At the beginning of a new round, the President<br />placard moves clockwise to the next player, who<br />is the new Presidential Candidate.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Nominate a Chancellor</strong><br />The Presidential Candidate chooses a Chancellor<br />Candidate by passing the Chancellor placard to<br />any other eligible player. The Presidential<br />Candidate is free to discuss Chancellor options<br />with the table to build consensus and make it<br />more likely the Government gets elected.</p>
    <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong><br />The last elected President and Chancellor are<br />&ldquo;term-limited,&rdquo; and ineligible to be nominated<br />as Chancellor Candidate.</p>
    <p><span style="color: #b36b00;">ON ELIGIBILITY:</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">&bull; Term limits apply to the President and</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">Chancellor who were last elected, not to the</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">last pair nominated. </span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #b36b00;">&bull; Term limits only affect nominations to the</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">Chancellorship; anyone can be President, even</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">someone who was just Chancellor.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #b36b00;">&bull; If there are only five players left in the</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">game, only the last elected Chancellor is</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">ineligible to be Chancellor Candidate; the</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">last President may be nominated.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #b36b00;">&bull; There are some other rules that affect</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">eligibility in specific ways: the Veto Power</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">and the Election Tracker. You don&rsquo;t need to</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">worry about those yet, and we&rsquo;ll talk about</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">each one in its relevant section.</span></p>
    <p>3. <strong>Vote on the government</strong><br />Once the Presidential Candidate has chosen an<br />eligible Chancellor Candidate, players may<br />discuss the proposed government until everyone<br />is ready to vote. Every player, including the<br />Candidates, votes on the proposed government.<br />Once everyone is ready to vote, reveal your<br />Ballot cards simultaneously so that everyone&rsquo;s<br />vote is public.</p>
    <p><strong>If the vote is a tie, or if a majority of</strong><br /><strong>players votes no:</strong></p>
    <p>The vote fails. The Presidential Candidate<br />misses this chance to be elected, and the<br />President placard moves clockwise to the next<br />player. The Election Tracker is advanced by<br />one Election.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Election Tracker</strong>: If the group rejects three<br />governments in a row, the country is thrown into<br />chaos. Immediately reveal the Policy on top of<br />the Policy deck and enact it. Any power granted<br />by this Policy is ignored, but the Election<br />Tracker resets, and existing term-limits are<br />forgotten. All players become eligible to hold<br />the office of Chancellor for the next Election.<br />If there are fewer than three tiles remaining in<br />the Policy deck at this point, shuffle them with<br />the Discard pile to create a new Policy deck.</p>
    <p><em>Any time a new Policy tile is played face-up,</em><br /><em>the Election Tracker is reset, whether it was</em><br /><em>enacted by an elected government or enacted by</em><br /><em>the frustrated populace.</em></p>
    <p><strong>If a majority of players votes yes:</strong></p>
    <p>The Presidential Candidate and Chancellor<br />Candidate become the new President and<br />Chancellor, respectively.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>If three or more Fascist Policies have been</strong><br /><strong>enacted already:</strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br /><em>Ask if the new Chancellor is Hitler. If</em><br /><em>so, the game is over and the Fascists win.</em><br /><em>Otherwise, other players know for sure the</em><br /><em>Chancellor is not Hitler.</em></p>
    <p><br />Proceed as usual to the Legislative Session.</p>
    <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>LEGISLATIVE SESSION</em></span></h3>
    <p><br />During the Legislative Session, the President<br />and Chancellor work together to enact a new<br />Policy in secret. The President draws the top<br />three tiles from the Policy deck, looks at them<br />in secret, and discards one tile face down into<br />the Discard pile. The remaining two tiles go to<br />the Chancellor, who looks in secret, discards<br />one Policy tile face down, and enacts the<br />remaining Policy by placing the tile face up on<br />the corresponding track.</p>
    <p>Verbal and nonverbal communication between the<br />President and Chancellor is forbidden. The<br />President and Chancellor MAY NOT pick Policies<br />to play at random, shuffle the tiles before<br />discarding one, or do anything else clever to<br />avoid secretly and intentionally selecting a<br />Policy. Additionally, the President should hand<br />both Policies over at the same time, rather<br />than one at a time to gauge the Chancellor&rsquo;s<br />reaction. Attempting to telegraph the contents<br />of your hand using randomness or any other<br />unusual selection procedure violates the spirit<br />of the game. Don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Discarded Policy tiles should never be revealed</strong><br /><strong>to the group. Players must rely on the word of</strong><br /><strong>the President and Chancellor, who are free to</strong><br /><strong>lie.</strong></p>
    <p><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;"><strong>ABOUT LYING:</strong> Often, some players learn</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">things that the rest of the players</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">don&rsquo;t know, like when the President and</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">Chancellor get to see Policy tiles, or</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">when a President uses the Investigate</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">power to see someone&rsquo;s Party Membership</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">card. You can always lie about hidden</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">knowledge in Secret Hitler. The only time</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">players MUST tell the truth is in gameending, Hitler-related scenarios: a player</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">who is Hitler must say so if assassinated</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">or if elected Chancellor after three</span><br /><span style="color: #b36b00;">Fascist Policies have been enacted.</span></p>
    <p><br /><strong>If there are fewer than three tiles remaining</strong><br /><strong>in the Policy deck at the end of a Legislative</strong><br /><strong>Session</strong>, shuffle them with the Discard pile to<br />create a new Policy deck. Unused Policy tiles<br />should never be revealed, and they should not be<br />simply placed on top of the new Policy deck.</p>
    <p><strong>If the government enacted a Fascist Policy that</strong><br /><strong>covered up a Presidential Power,</strong> the sitting<br />President gets to use that power. Proceed to the<br />Executive Action.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>If the government enacted a Liberal Policy or</strong><br /><strong>a Fascist Policy that grants no Presidential</strong><br /><strong>Power,</strong> begin a new round with a new Election.</p>
    <h3><br /><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EXECUTIVE ACTION</span></em></h3>
    <p>If the newly-enacted Fascist Policy grants a<br />Presidential Power, the President must use it<br />before the next round can begin. Before using<br />a power, the President is free to discuss the<br />issue with other players, but ultimately the<br />President gets to decide how and when the power<br />is used. Gameplay cannot continue until the<br />President uses the power. Presidential Powers<br />are used only once; they don&rsquo;t stack or roll<br />over to future turns.</p>
    <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRESIDENTIAL POWERS</span></h4>
    <p><br /><strong>Investigate Loyalty</strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br />The President chooses a player to<br />investigate. Investigated players<br />should hand their Party Membership<br />card (not Secret Role card!) to the<br />President, who checks the player&rsquo;s<br />loyalty in secret and then returns<br />the card to the player. The President<br />may share (or lie about!) the<br />results of their investigation at<br />their discretion. No player may be<br />investigated twice in the same game.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Call Special Election</strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br />The President chooses any other<br />player at the table to be the next<br />Presidential Candidate by passing<br />that player the President placard.<br />Any player can become President&mdash;even<br />players that are term-limited. The<br />new President nominates an eligible<br />player as Chancellor Candidate and<br />the Election proceeds as usual.<br />A Special Election does not skip any<br />players. After a Special Election,<br />the President placard returns to the<br />left of the President who enacted the</p>
    <p><strong>Special Election</strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br />If the President passes the<br />presidency to the next player in the<br />rotation, that player would get to<br />run for President twice in a row:<br />once for the Special Election and<br />once for their normal shift in the<br />Presidential rotation.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Policy Peek</strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br />The President secretly looks at the<br />top three tiles in the Policy deck and<br />then returns them to the top of the<br />deck without changing the order.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Execution</strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br />The President executes one player<br />at the table by saying &ldquo;I formally<br />execute [player name].&rdquo; If that<br />player is Hitler, the game ends in<br />a Liberal victory. If the executed<br />player is not Hitler, the table<br />should not learn whether a Fascist or<br />a Liberal has been killed; players<br />must try to work out for themselves<br />the new table balance. Executed<br />players are removed from the game and<br />may not speak, vote, or run<br />for office.</p>
    <h3><br /><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VETO POWER</span></em></h3>
    <p><br />The Veto Power is a special rule that comes into<br />effect after five Fascist Policies have been<br />enacted. For all Legislative Sessions after the<br />fifth Fascist Policy is enacted, the Executive<br />branch gains a permanent new ability to discard<br />all three Policy tiles if both the Chancellor<br />and President agree.<br />The President draws three Policy tiles,<br />discards one, and passes the remaining two to<br />the Chancellor as usual. Then Chancellor may,<br />instead of enacting either Policy, say &ldquo;I wish<br />to veto this agenda.&rdquo; If the President consents<br />by saying, &ldquo;I agree to the veto,&rdquo; both Policies<br />are discarded and the President placard passes<br />to the left as usual. If the President does not<br />consent, the Chancellor must enact a Policy<br />as normal.</p>
    <p>Each use of the Veto Power represents an<br />inactive government and advances the Election<br />Tracker by one.</p>
    <h2><br />STRATEGY NOTES</h2>
    <p><br />&bull;<strong> Everyone should claim to be a Liberal</strong>. Since<br />the Liberal team has a voting majority, it can<br />easily shut out any player claiming to be a<br />Fascist. As a Fascist, there is no advantage to<br />outing yourself to the majority. Additionally,<br />Liberals should usually tell the truth. Liberals<br />are trying to figure out the game like a puzzle,<br />so lying can put their team at a<br />significant disadvantage.</p>
    <p><br />&bull; <strong>If this is your first time playing Hitler,</strong><br /><strong>just remember: be as Liberal as possible</strong>. Enact<br />Liberal Policies. Vote for Liberal governments.<br />Kiss babies. Trust your fellow Fascists to<br />create opportunities for you to enact Liberal<br />Policies and to advance Fascism on their turns.<br />The Fascists win by subtly manipulating the<br />table and waiting for the right cover to enact<br />Fascist Policies, not by overtly playing<br />as evil.</p>
    <p><br />&bull; <strong>Liberals frequently benefit from slowing play</strong><br /><strong>down and discussing the available information.</strong><br />Fascists frequently benefit from rushing votes<br />and creating confusion.</p>
    <p><br />&bull; <strong>Fascists most often win by electing Hitler,</strong><br /><strong>not by enacting six Policies!</strong> Electing Hitler<br />isn&rsquo;t an optional or secondary win condition,<br />it&rsquo;s the core of a successful Fascist strategy.<br />Hitler should always play as a Liberal, and<br />should generally avoid lying or getting into<br />fights and disagreements with other players.<br />When the time comes, Hitler needs the Liberals&rsquo;<br />trust to get elected. Even if Hitler isn&rsquo;t<br />ultimately elected, the distrust sown among<br />Liberals is key to getting Fascists elected late<br />in the game.</p>
    <p><br />&bull;<strong> Ask other players to explain why they took</strong><br /><strong>an action.</strong> This is especially important with<br />Presidential Powers&mdash;in fact, ask ahead of time<br />whom a candidate is thinking of investigating/<br />appointing/assassinating.</p>
    <p><br />&bull; <strong>If a Fascist Policy comes up, there are only</strong><br /><strong>three possible culprits: The President, the</strong><br /><strong>Chancellor, or the Policy Deck</strong>. Try to figure<br />out who (or what!) put you in this position.</p>
